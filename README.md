# Automatically Updating Desktop with NASA APOD

This script pulls the latest Astronomy Picture of the Day from http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/, saves it to my HD and sets it as the wallpaper.

### Adding to crontab

I use the following to automatically update my desktop on boot.

    crontab -e
    @reboot /bin/bash -l -c 'cd ~/Desktop/nasa_auto_apod_desktop && ruby fetch_apod.rb'
